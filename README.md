# IAPS invoice tool
Generate nice PDF invoice with LaTeX and Python
Original version by @loelkes

# Motivation
The tool reads information from the IAPS membership fee spreadsheet and automatically creates invoices from it.

# What does it do?
This generator creates PDF-Documents with LaTeX.

The created invoices comply in many points (but not all) with DIN 5008. They have the folding marks, the address at the right place so you can use envelopes with a windows, contact information in the footer...
